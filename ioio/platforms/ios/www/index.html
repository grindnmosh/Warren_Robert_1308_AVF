				<li>Keeping in mind that you said Twitter would appear still in
				some lessons and that we should replace it in all cases with
				Instagram, my writing covers Instagram in place of Twitter
				where applicable.</li>
				
				<li>Instagram could be used to as a built in login to the apps
				private areas or cross device/web storage for auto population
				of Data already entered onto a new device. This would also
				allow for instant syncing across the devices allowing Instagram
				to be used as cloud storage. I have never actually seen this in
				any app, used with Instagram. This is more commonly seen with
				Facebook or Google+ logins and occasionally Twitter logins. I
				prefer the apps I have seen that give you the choice between
				direct login with no cloud support or the multiple social
				network login options with cloud support. I like the apps that
				have a simple backup sync with more popular direct cloud
				options like Dropbox or Box. I intend to use the Facebook Like
				API, the Google+ +1 API, the Twitter Follow API, Evernote
				syncing API as well as include the Dropbox API for backing up
				Data. I just need to learn how to implement these API features.
				I also want to make the login options of some or all of these
				available. I would love to say this would all happen this month
				but we will see.</li>
				
				<li>JSON-P is an interesting concept, in the fact that is lets
				use Data from another domain. This allows you to pull data from
				the API’s source websites with no issues. Cross platform the
				browser generally denies data unless wrapped in script tags,
				which makes the data useless beyond evaluating it. JSON-P uses
				this loophole to gain access to cross-domain data and wraps it
				in a way that makes it fully usable. Without JSON-P a call for
				data would involve several steps of calling your server, which
				calls on the API’s server, which in turn sends it back to your
				server then to you. That is a lot slower in getting returned
				data than directly getting it and only JSON-P can currently do
				this effectively. So JSON-P apps definitely provide an
				advantage in getting data returned to you faster.</li>
				
				<li>Some of the APIs that blend best with native functions that
				I found actually blend between native features. The camera
				would blend well with any of your social media services.
				Storage would blend well with cloud services like Dropbox, Box
				or even Facebook or Google+. The Network feature works well
				with the in-app web browser, the social networks, the cloud
				storage, the sharing features using email or messaging and
				anything else that needs to pull information from or even
				sending information to the web. Contacts can be used to sync
				with any of the incorporated services or to populate into
				services. These would sync well with sharing options using
				social network APIs. The options are limitless and these are
				only some general examples.</li>
				
				<li>My intentions this month is to begin my social network
				promotional integration and multi device sync support into my
				app and add the features needed to take full advantage of
				native features like contacts, calendar, network, internal
				storage and when applicable SD card support. I know SD storage
				will only be an option for the Android side for most devices
				but this is a highly request feature of Android users so I do
				intend to implement it. I intend to have at least the basic
				functionality to make the app fully useable by the end of this
				month and have it available on both app stores. This is an app
				that I already enjoy using in the mobile web version I have and
				I have had requests to be a beta tester for this app when it
				becomes available for such. I already discussed in the first
				paragraph some detailed desires for the use of API’s in this
				app.</li>
				
				<li>We have learned so much up till now and honestly it is
				really jumbled up in my head as to where or when I learned
				what. It is even jumbled which techniques I have just formed in
				combination of what I have learned in class, from others or
				just trial and error. But I will try to break down these three
				categories. As far as research, this is the most important step
				in any project. You should a lot time before beginning the
				structuring of the project itself to research the why, how to
				and effective use of the big picture of what you want to do.
				This in turn creates a need for additional research on the
				components that need to be incorporated, some of which you had
				already planned and some that you hadn’t previously thought of.
				This creates it’s own research. Once you have completed your
				thorough research you are ready to begin the design stage. The
				design stage should include two main pieces. They are our
				wireframe and your flowchart. As you build these you find the
				need for even more components to complete your goals returning
				you to the research stage. This is also the stage to plan your
				apps branding, which may change as you go. Once your planning
				is complete, it is time to begin the design stages. This is the
				point when you start writing your primary code, which has been
				html5 so far. We then make it look nice with CSS. We finally
				make it function with our JavaScript or JavaScript libraries
				such as jQuery. The final step is to add data sources and
				native functionality to make the app function as we envisioned
				it. One of the biggest things I have learned and something I
				want to ensure is included, is to not over think it. As humans
				that is our biggest flaw.</li>

				<li>Accessibility is something I have looked forward to learning. I know people who have to use these features regularly. It was interesting to discover that heading, section, image and link tags are the most accessible and how the reader reads the code. Some of the ways I can update my code to be more accessible is clear and intuitive labeling of all my tags. For example on images I will go through my code and change the alt tags to a definitive 1 or 2 word description. All my headings and section tags will be made clearer and my links will be as plain and straightforward as possible. I will also try to update away from tags that are ignored. I am excited to know the large impact these simple steps will make.</li>

				<li>So I watched several demos recorded by the blind demoing the accessibility features on iPhone and Android. I really enjoyed 1 video that left the video as a black screen and described to me how to use voiceover on the iPhone. What I found was a common issue that was brought up several times was the complicated gestures to do certain actions. One of the common complaints was the 3-finger swipe to change app pages on the iPhone that does not like to react correctly. Also these screen readers depend on the website and application developers to code the pages in a readable coding layout with clear tags and image alts. This is definitely a native feature that would be beneficial in a successful app. I can definitely see the benefit in my bill app being screen reader friendly.</li>

				<li>Devices being designed specifically to support accessibility are fairly common practice. Computers, smart phones, tablets and home appliances have really become intuitive players in the accessibility market. Computers, smart phones and tablets come with native screen readers, magnifiers and a whole range of other accessibility features. Our home appliances have become smarter and now have touch screen controls with accessibility features to read the settings out loud so you know what water temperature or timeframe you are setting up. You can check how much longer and so much more with the smart appliances being offered today. Accessibility specific device features are expected and native features of today’s technology.</li>

				<li>As far as Apps go let me tell you about a few of the coolest ones I found. The first one is an app for Android called Georgie. It is available in the UK and you can see a demo on the <a href="#" onclick="window.open('http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dzPH_OYb6I','_blank','location=yes')">Georgie demo</a>  on YouTube. Georgie replaces your home screen launcher and allows you to simply hold down large buttons to hear what it is and continue to hold it till it launches. It has the important apps right on the first page such as the phone, contacts, weather and places. These apps have also been reformatted to work with Georgie. Places for example allow you to find out directions, what’s near by bus schedules and many other GPS based needs. It also has an assistance function that would be used if you got lost, for example. You would hit the assistance button and it sends a message to your caregiver letting them know where you are. That’s just a small amount of what this app can do. The second app is Looktel Money Reader for iOS, which is an app that instantly recognizes currency and speaks the denomination. This allows a visually impaired or blind person to count their money or verify what denomination a bill is before giving to a cashier. It then allows them to verify they have received the correct change. Both of these apps appear very functional and would help simplify the covered areas of their lives. The second app has actually given me a few ideas for a feature of my bill app, maybe down the road. </li>

			<h3>Industry Research</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Before we get into top selling apps in the markets we will focus on today I want to give some remarkable statistics that were posted on March 13th, 2013. according to the article, Teens and Technology, 78% of teens now have a cell phone, and almost half (47%) of those own smartphones. That translates into 37% of all teens who have smartphones, up from just 23% in 2011. Then to go even further, one in four teens (23%) have a tablet computer, a level comparable to the general adult population and nine in ten (93%) teens have a computer or have access to one at home.(Madden, Lenhart, Duggan, Cortesi & Gasser, 2013) So while smartphones become more common and the tablet market grows, we need to be aware of the large share of that market that is owned by our youth. That should and will have an impact on our design styles.</li>

				<li>We are focusing on on 3 markets this wee to discover what is popular in each. For this I will be focusing on iOS as I had trouble finding a current cross platform study on categories. We are also starting our iOS leg next week. In addition the most recent report on categories is from 2011. So I will be using top 5 Appsv generated on August 25th, 2013. The top 5 iPad Apps in the U.S are Asphalt 8, Minecraft, Rotowire Fantasy Football Draft Kit 2013, NFL Fantasy Football Cheat Sheet 2013 and Notability. In Japan they are Asphalt 8, Notepad+, Puffin Web Browser, GoodReader and 1日5分で身に付くデキる人の速読術(5 Minutes a Day). In the United Kingdom you have you have Asphalt 8, Minecraft, Mister Maker, Pixel Gun 3d and Pimp Your Screen. ("App Annie" 2013)</li>

				<li>What I get from what these countries have in common is a love of racing simulation. Asphalt 8 is number one, not just in these 3 countries but in pretty much every country. outside of game apps, the apps that make it to the top are productivity, sports statistics, art and usable utilities like web browsers. In the US games and sports and note taking utilities are very popular and the top apps are simple and have a simple usability. In Japan, while Asphalt 8 is number 1 it is the only game in the top 5. Productivity and utility apps are most common in the top ranking apps. That tells me they are more professional in their mindset and want apps that offer solution to their professional needs. The United Kingdom is more similar to the U.S. when it comes to games being the most common category in top apps. Phone customization apps and artist based apps have the place on top paid apps which tells me that while they love to play video games, many also enjoy being creative in various ways to express themselves.</li>

				<li>We are fortunate in the U.S. because we can choose to overpay and have limited data or get a good price and have unlimited data. Of the big 4 we have 2 on each side of that fence. But even the unlimited has throttling levels based on data plan, again with unlimited as an option. Japan seems to have those same options including throttling. For example the iPhone 5 4G LTE unlimited data plan is throttled once you reach 1.2GBs on Softbank.("Softbank iphone 5," 2012) The U.K also has similar options with their limited plans and fair use plans. The limited plans offer the better pricing but charge you when you go over the limit. The fair use plans are unlimited with a fair use cap which seems to commonly be at 500mb.("Best mobile data," 2011) So even the unlimited plans would create challenges for high data usage apps. High data usage apps are best used on wifi. We definitely need to consider this when designing our apps.</li>

				<li>	We need to design apps with offline storage options that sync only when connected at certain minimum speeds. Where if the phone has been throttled it will not try to upload data. Or another common approach I have seen in many apps I use is an option in the settings to toggle wifi only syncing on and off to help those with limited plans. One of these options should be included with any app that needs to sync data online because something we haven’t taken into consideration here is the large number of wifi only tablets in the market. The only time these have data is when connected to wifi. There is nothing worse than an app you cant use at all because there is no wifi. I have uninstalled more games and utilities because they don’t offer an offline option from my iPad and Optik.</li>

				<li>My suggested strategy for my application in all 3 markets would be to make available in the 3 different currencies for bill amount with internal and external storage with an online account option. The online account option would include a toggle to wifi only/cellular data for syncing to the online storage. This would give those with the unlimited data the option to always be syncing while protecting those with limited data. This strategy also alleviates the requirement for data as the user can choose to use the local storage options only. I believe this strategy is the best option for the app I am currently working on. This will allow for a larger audience to enjoy my free app regardless which global market I make it available in. Another feature I would need to add is globalization for language options as well as making the appropriate updates to currency and language usage of each individual culture.</li>
